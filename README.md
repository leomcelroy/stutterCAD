This is an extension of my undergraduate physics/computer science joint thesis, done at Middlebury College.

It is a geometric constraint solver that uses automatic differentiation and the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm.

It is intended to enable the creation of a web-based CAD program.

Here is a [demo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tXekoaCkauH1ZYWsYV5z9nKwwMsv0ImA).
