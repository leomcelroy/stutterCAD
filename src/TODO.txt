-------Higher Priority-------
-Numerical inputs for transformations
-Offsets
-Undo/Redo
-Drag pivot point
-Tangent
-Coincident with Line or Arc
-Midpoint
-Mirror with clones
-Fillet
-Trim
-Set specific angle
-Automatic Constraints
-Add Better Handling of Constraint Inputs
  -Clones and ControlPoints shouldn't have constraints added
-Parameter checks on all input boxes
-If tool is in use then on change end all operations and make ready for next tool
-Copy and clone beziers, arcs, circles (currently only does lines and points)
-Finish esc and enter drawing edits
-Redo constraint solver like solvespace
-Console Contents
  -Unmet constraints
  -Numerical inputs for transformations
  -Constraint Inputs
  -Errors in input values

-------Medium Priority-------
-Vectorize BitMap
-Symmetric
-Mirror (Makes New Curves/Lines with Constraits)
-Display progenitor of clones on select or highlight (like constraints)
-Import Image
-Add external variables for dimensions
-Ellipses
-Add/remove points from Beziers
-Repeat (circular or rectangular pattern)

-------Lower Priority-------
-Save DXFs
-Multiple Pastes
-Slot
-Offset
-Coincident with curve
-Horizontal Distance
-Vertical Distance
-Extend
-Split at Intersection
-Pierce
-Normal
-Adjust lambda in lm
-Add command search triggered by space bar
-Guide line
-Rulers on sides

-------Other Decisions-------
-Hiding constraint display when transforming is not the most elegant way to handle all those temporarily unmet constraints
-Choose which matrix library is fastest
-Decide whether to use old parsing method or new one
-Improve UI, (Change away from Svg-React-Pan-Zoom)
-Refactor Code
-Don't edit points directly in direct transformations
-Should progenitors change of clones of directly transformed shapes

-------BUGS-------
-Constraints of lower level points (coincident points that are buried) are not visible
-Circle constraint is insufficient
-Reset makes hotkeys not work
-Dragging line and co-linear point makes it crash
-Tool changes mid-use can F*** stuff up

-------Remember-------
-Onshape, solvespace, jsketcher, and fusion360 parametric capabilities
-vectr, gravit, svgEdit for drawing capabilities

-------DONE-------
-Bezier control point switch while adding
-Copy and Paste (with constraints)
-Save and Upload (Upload needs to maintain shapes and constraints)
-Transform (Translate (x or y), Rotate, Scale (x or y))
-Fix issue with hover stuck on, maybe put the highlight thing in the group (Did it with that mouseUp hack. A better solution would be desirable)
-Circles
-Selection for beziers, arcs, circles
-Make Construction Line
-Delete clones of directly transformed shapes (or should prog change)
-Remove constraints from shapes destroyed by transform (clean up should be unified with delete clean up)
-Clone
-Rectangles
-Arcs
-Add Selection Boxes
-Resize workpieceSize
-Export (SVG or PDF)
-Delete lines that are missing points
-Issue with selection and losing focus (!) (was because this.state.shapes was being mutated by sort)
-Add ability to switch joint type on bezier points (do it while drawing too) (symmetric/disconnected)
-Equal
-Prevent constraints from going to zero
-remove unneeded variables before solving
-Beziers
-bezier points have an edit mode when control points are visible and selectable
-make known things to points in update function
-make only visible and selectable when controlled is selected
-make beziers grouped
-make pointIDs random 32 bit strings
-want bezier control point pairs stored together
-need to access controls of bezier point and pair of control points
-control points can't be constrained
-when bezier points are moved so are control points
-how to close single stroke bezier?
-make it so control points don't change?
-add partner control point
